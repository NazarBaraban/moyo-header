# Moyo header
- [DEMO LINK](https://nazarbaraban.github.io/layout_moyo-header/)

Created an HTML page with a responsive header based on the provided mockup. The header layout adapts to both 1024px and 1200px screen widths. It utilizes semantic HTML tags, styles for link hover effects, an is-active class for the active link, and a data-qa="hover" attribute on the fourth link for testing. The design closely follows the mockup, including font styles and spacing.
